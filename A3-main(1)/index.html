            <p>Emi Takahashi is an artist and graphic designer based in Toronto. Her practice involves experimenting with alternative & analog forms of image-making, glyph & type design, archival projects, and multidisciplinary collaborations. Michelle Kuan is a Chinese Canadian artist, designer, and writer based in Montréal. Working between social practice, digital arts, and experimental publishing, she explores novel ways of documenting personal and collective narratives, the power of somatic memory, and decolonial archival futures. Their research laden practices operate both individually and collectively to create a mix of client-based and self-initiated work such as their here-there stories project devoted to collecting the stories of the asian canadian diaspora. </p>
